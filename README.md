the script is oretty straight foward, it pulls the METAR data via an API and the NOAA buoy data via txt file and parses it into a JSON file.
Said JSON file is read by the HTML document which is then outputted in much less disgusting format.

The basic webscraping was done for the most opart by me, AI helped when i came time to translate the python script into a Flask script and a html document.

The embedded cam was dont by me and some others

some future to dos, have a webscraper look at the MCCS WS instagram page and tell what flag conditions and what they are calling

poss 3 day outlook, but that will be more intestive as I have to pull NWS storm data

eventually the goal is to forecast surf heights. maybe make an expirmental feature and see how it fares.

hope this consalidated info makes it easier, thanks :)
